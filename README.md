  Project Overview
This project tackles the challenge of anomaly segmentation in real-world scenarios by building compact models capable of real-time deployment. Utilizing the Cityscapes dataset for training, we explore several baseline methods, including Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP), MaxLogit, and Max Entropy, using a pre-trained ERF-Net model. Additionally, we implement temperature scaling to assess the impact of the T parameter on out-of-distribution (OoD) object detection performance.
The models' performances are evaluated using metrics such as Area under the Precision-Recall Curve (AuPRC) and False Positive Rate at 95% True Positive Rate (FPR95). We also assess the models' capabilities for in-distribution object detection and image classification using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU). The results highlight the significant degradation in anomaly detection performance due to domain shift.
